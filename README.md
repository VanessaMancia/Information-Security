<h1>Information Security Analyst Projects</h1>

<b> This is a set of collaboration projects between [Faris Nabeel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fnabeel/) and [Vanessa Mancia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanessamancia/). We are both Cybersecurity Professionals looking to share our expertise. 

We deep dive into configuring our own cloud-based SOC within Azure, using Microsoft Sentinel as our SIEM. We will setup logging, alerts, and practice incident response against live, malicious traffic.<b/>
